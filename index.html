        <h1>SIMPLIFIED SSBU SCOREBOARD</h1>

    <h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <h3><u>Basic Setup</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on Scoreboard and Controller</li>
            <li>add the link to the scoreboard as a browser source in OBS</li>
            <li>(optional) add the controller to OBS as a dock</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><u>Advanced Features</u></h3>
        <h4>Using Start.gg Match Numbers</h4>
        <p>NOTE: this feature may be buggy as the current code is for the local event this overlay was originally made for.<br>
            That said, it will only work if the ultimate singles (pulling matchdata is not setup to work with doubles events yet) event is the first event listed on the 
            "start.gg/tournaments/[event name]/event" page. 
            If your event is not set up this way, consider checking out the source code and downloading a version to modify yourself 
            as the scoreboard can be used via launching the html files as a live server from VS CODE.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain a start.gg api token (these are case sensitive and should be treated as a password, this site does not save token info)</li>
            <li>Enter the API token into the controller</li>
            <li>in the tournament link field of the controller, enter the "/tournaments/[event name]" part of the event link</li>
            <li>Now you can get tags from matches by simply entering the match identifier into the match number field (the match identifier is the 1-2 letters next to a set)</li>
        </ol>
