    <h3><u>Basic Setup</u></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the links on the top bar for the controller and scoreboard in a new tab <br><img src="images/links.PNG">
      </li>
      <li>add the link to the scoreboard as a browser source in OBS Studio
        <ol>
          <li> Copy the link to the scoreboard </li>
          <li> Add a New Browser source in OBS Studio <br><img src="images/addbrowser_source.png" height="600"></li>
          <li> Paste the link and ensure that its size is 1920x1080 (also check your stream settings to ensure that its
            output and window size is also 1920x1080)<br><img src="images/scoreboardadd.PNG" width="700">
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>add the controller to OBS Studio as a dock, this step is optional but is recommended as it allows you to use
        the controller from within OBS Studio
        thus removing the need to flip through tabs
        <ol>
          <li> Copy the link to the controller </li>
          <li> On the top bar in OBS, click on "docks" > "custom browser docks" <br><img src="images/docks.png"
              height="700"></li>
          <li> paste the link to the controller and name it <br><img src="images/adock.PNG">
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> You are now done with the basic setup and should have somthing like the below screenshot,
        (docks in OBS sort of behave like windows in windows so if you dont like it floating around you can drag it and
        place it in the panels as you please)
        <br> <img src="images/finalresult.PNG" width="800">
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="advanced"><u>Advanced Features</u></h3>
    <h4>Using Start.gg Match Numbers</h4>
    <p>NOTE: this feature may be buggy as the current code is for the local event this overlay was originally made
      for and is hard coded to take look for the bracket in a from a certain place (This is as i initially planed to not
      publish this).<br>
      That said, it will only work if the ultimate singles (pulling match data is not setup to work with doubles events
      yet) event is the first event listed on the
      "start.gg/tournaments/[event name]/event" page.
      If your event is not set up this way, consider checking out the
      <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-McMahon85/simplified-smash-scoreboard">source code and downloading a version to
        modify yourself</a>
      as the scoreboard can be used via launching the scoreboard and controller html files as a live server directly
      from VS CODE using the
      <a href=https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">live server add on.</a>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Obtain a <a
          href="https://developer.start.gg/docs/authentication/#:~:text=Generating%20a%20Token,AND%20fill%20out%20this%20form.">
          start.gg api token</a>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (these are case sensitive and should be treated as a password, this site does not save token info, for
            transparency this project is <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-McMahon85/simplified-smash-scoreboard">
              open source and hosted via github pages)</a></li>
          <li>
            (Additionally, start.gg will only show your token to you once upon generation so be sure to save it
            somewhere secure)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter the API token into the controller <br>
        <img src="images/token.PNG" height="500">
      </li>
      <li>
        in the tournament link field of the controller, enter the "/tournaments/[event name]" part of the event link
        <div class="brln">
          <img src="images/link_example.png">
          <br>
          <img src="images/bracket_link.PNG">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can get tags from matches by simply entering the match identifier into the match number field (the
        match identifier is the 1-2 letters next to a set)
